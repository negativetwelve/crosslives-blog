If you use any message boards, then you know about the off-topic forum. It’s magical mayhem. You all come to the site for a singular passion you share, even if you have differing opinions within that area. However divided you might feel on the main purpose of the site, you enter an even crazier conflict in the Off Topic section.

It’s fascinating to see how people who share so much in one area can also hold such divided interests in seemingly any other area. At a certain point, you think about the ideal “profile” of an Oakland Raiders fan and realize that no profile exists.  Like, literally.

That’s the beautiful thing about the internet. We’re not grouped together by demographics. I’m not an Asian-early twenties-single man. I am a “user” that is passionate about basketball, technology, and rhythmic gymnastics (what???). Yup, you can’t classify me because I am uniquely individual. All of us are. And that’s what the internet brings us together for. The internet sees through the outside and only cares about our core.

That’s why I love the Off-Topic forum. It’s an exciting experiment in seeing the chemistry between a group of people who love one thing with a passion, but each hold such uniquely different interests elsewhere that are illuminated in this forum.

Many people actually end up as more active users of the Off-Topic forum than the main forum of a site.  I can't quite explain it; you just have to join it. You feel a sense of community that is so seemingly random, but it works. It's a reason why some people might ask a question in an Off-Topic forum rather than asking it in another message board specialized for that topic. There is this sense of trust and family camaraderie that can supersede pure expertise. It’s a social experiment, and one that draws in so many people.

This site is about to take that experiment to another level.
