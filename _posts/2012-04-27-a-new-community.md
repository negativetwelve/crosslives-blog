It’s about time our lives crossed together. 

Our startup stemmed from a simple, yet universal problem: community fragmentation. On Facebook, we can view our entire personal network on one universal site. On the public sphere, you weave through several websites to engage in various communities. It’s the reason why message board users usually consist of the more hardcore loyalists. It takes a lot of effort—too much effort. Consequently, two problems exist.

1.  Most people participate on 2-3 message boards, if any at all (and the majority don’t)
2.  Discussion communities consist of those that are already incredibly passionate about a subject, not for people who are DISCOVERING new passions and STRENGTHENING current ones.

Many sites have attempted community creation in one way or another over the past few years (Quora, Reddit, Meetup). However, we put our singular focus into a platform where people can create and move in between communities. Here’s what we believe:

1.  **You learn more when you’re with others that know more than you.** There’s a quote that says “if you’re the smartest person in the room, find someone else or go to a different room.” Well, now you can actually do that.
2.  **Everyone has several passions and interests.** We want people to develop not just primary interests, but also latent interests. One of my friends has always had a passion for archeology, but he never had anyone to talk about it with. So he just reads news articles about it once every while. I want to fix that problem.
3.  **Your best friend is out there, somewhere.** The world is divided into “people you know” and “people you don’t know.”  We firmly believe that you can learn much more from everyone than when you’re alone. However, there are many Q&A sites out there. We want you to learn more, but we also want you to build more relationships. In real life, you often have some sort of similarity with your friends right? Imagine if the world is your potential friend pool; your best friend might be there waiting for you.
4.  **Everyone matters.** I hate how so many places rely on reputation or fame to promote popularity. It left me thinking, “<u>I wish I mattered.</u>” We want a site where your worth is measured by what you know and what you do, not who you are.
5.  **We love what we care about.** Social media right now is great and all. Friend updates, event updates, games, procrastination. At a certain point though, I’m just on it because I’m on it. However, you get me talking about basketball? I can talk about that all day, every day. We don’t love social media. We love discussion communities.

We’re glad our lives crossed together for this experiment. None of us know what will happen from this, but we can guarantee it will be a crazy ride.
