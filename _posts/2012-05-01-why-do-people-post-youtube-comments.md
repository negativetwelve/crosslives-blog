Reading Youtube comments always yields interesting experiences. It’s a scary place, filled with noise that drowns out among the thousands of comments (just check any of the Top Viewed videos). Knowing full well that their voices will never realistically get heard, why do people still participate on Youtube?

Well, we all love to be heard. Whether it’s on a playground or at that important meeting, we need validation. We measure our lives compared to others, because we’re social creatures. We’re running around like kids saying, “look, I belong” or “look, I matter.” We join organizations, non-profits, and events for the people as much as the purpose. When was the last time you volunteered for a long-term commitment that involved you being by yourself?

Don Draper said it best. “You're born alone and you die alone and this world just drops a bunch of rules on top of you to make you forget those facts.” The scariest moments sting when you do feel alone, truly and deeply alone. It’s why constructs such as prestige and fame exist, because we put value in other’s opinions and their recognition.

However, not everyone can get recognition. Not everyone can win employee of the month. Hell, many struggle just to serve or stay as an employee. It’s simple supply and demand. Everyone wants that feeling of interpersonal worth. Not everyone gets it on the same levels. Devoid of those recognitions, people find outlets elsewhere.

That’s why people post Youtube comments, because some find that there.

Look through a Youtube comment conversation with that community lens, and you’ll see people interacting back and forth, whether in discussion or debate. You will see others screaming for attention, along with many that put those people down. You see chaos, but within the chaos, you see patterns and purpose. You see community, which itself serves as an entirely unique form of chaos.

We are shaped by the way others see us. We’re all connected, and we want to be connected. Often times, we just don’t know how. We seek different types of connections, and often times can’t get what we want. It’s why so many of us struggle, and why we live in such a chaotic community we call this world.

But maybe there’s a way to help others connect. Welcome to the experiment we call Crosslives.
