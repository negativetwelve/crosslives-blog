"I wish I mattered"

I remember the days of Myspace. I had 2000 friends online I think. That social graph made it so darn difficult to make the Facebook switch! I felt more popular online than offline. I felt that I mattered online, and that people cared about me. They were easy to maintain. Private network connections in general are easy to maintain. Of course, most of those relationships were meaningless. However, public communication is much different.

Enter Twitter. I hated Twitter with a passion because no one would ever follow me. Why should they? I had nothing valuable to say. With celebrities, reporters, and executives on Twitter, I realized just how little I mattered. My words may have fit a small audience had I carved it out, but I am a normal person. I’m not a Youtube entertainment personality or someone with a deeply fascinating background.

What role does social media play for normal people like us?

That’s tough to answer. Normal people do not live interesting enough lives to warrant attention. It’s controversy, gossip, and hyperbole that drives attention. It’s why we don’t see television networks dedicated to “good news” stories. They’re boring. So, if normal people do not live interesting enough lives, what value can they provide to the general public?

I believe that everyone is valuable. I believe anyone can say something that resonates with everyone. I believe that if given the right opportunity, anyone’s voice can be empowered online.

While our experiences and social status might not warrant attention, our thoughts do. A thought can empower; it can ignite controversy; it can spark change.

I believe that the way to make you matter online is to make your thoughts noticed. Regardless of your background, you bring a unique perspective. Best part?

Everyone’s thoughts can matter.
