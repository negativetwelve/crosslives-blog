Ever wish that you could keep in touch with someone today? You know, the long lost childhood friend that you slowly grew apart from when you went your different ways.

Life can cruelly pry away even the strongest of bonds. It’s one of our earliest lessons in reality, an early foreshadowing of just how imperfectly the world really works.

Sometimes, circumstance moves you apart. You go to a different school; you change jobs. If circumstance doesn’t do it, then time does. You move on, grow up, and try to tell yourself that it’s all for the better. You’ve matured and grown as a person. Life has helped you become who you were today. You know, these same people espouse the message of “never regret anything.” Right?

But if that was true, then why does nostalgia exist? Maybe, because…we aren’t always better in the future. Maybe that’s why adults tend to be a little more guarded, a little more jaded now: we know how life can rip away our hearts. I just talked to a friend the other day about her sister who broke up her boyfriend after seven years. The loss of those relationships creates holes in your heart. You can get a new relationship; you can fill that hole. However, you can’t fit that hole—not perfectly.

When did you feel happiest? And who were around you when you felt that? The best times of my life were not defined by than my accomplishments, but by my relationships.  Each relationship is a like snowflake. Those specific people helped you through quite specific times of your life. If you don't pay attention, that snowflake just blends with the pile and fades away forever. 

I hate it so much. I can’t change it, but I can help it, which is why we’re building this site.

Relationships flow with a volatile unpredictability. The key is to keep people in touch on a passive level, so you can hit up your jr. high friend and send a random “update” message, right? Many sites do that well from a contact filing perspective like Facebook and Linkedin. We know where they went to college, where they worked, and what they’re doing that particular weekend. However, we want a way to keep track of people’s opinions, thoughts, and passions. People are connected by passions, by common interests. We want you to stay connected to people by tracking their opinions, thoughts, and beliefs.

We never want relationships to go away. No matter what, we know some will, but we can help others. We want to keep relationships strong by the bonds that bind them the tightest: their passions.
